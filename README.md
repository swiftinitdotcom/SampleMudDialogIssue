# SampleMudDialogIssue

Change google map key to your key-

 <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=putyourkey&libraries=places"></script>
  
  and also check image dialogissue png showing the issue on our server. This works with normal page but with dialog it goes behind the dialog as you can see in screenshot.
